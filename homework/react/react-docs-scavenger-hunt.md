2. We are using JSX to write HTML inside of our React. Are we required to use JSX with React? Are there any alternatives?

    Answer: When writing HTML inside of a React app you are advised to use JSX, but NOT required to. An alternative would be to use the 'React.createElement' function with plain javaScript (which will be compiled by said function).

4. Should we ever change `props` (or parameters) inside of a component?

7. Do we have to use ES6 syntax with React?
